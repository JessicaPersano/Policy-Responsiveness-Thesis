# Policy-Responsiveness-Thesis
This repository contains R code and datasets for my UCLA political science honors thesis, "The Determinants of Policy Representation: Evaluating the Role of Policy Type in the US States." It includes data preprocessing, MRP models, policy responsiveness and congruence analysis, and visualization scripts. Expect frequent changes to code and data.
