# Policy-Responsiveness-Thesis
This repository contains the R scripts and datasets for my UCLA political science honors thesis, "The Determinants of Policy Representation: Evaluating the Role of Policy Type in the US States." My research examines how different types of policiesâ€”categorized by salience and moralityâ€”affect the degree to which state policies align with public opinion. Using Multilevel Regression and Poststratification (MRP), I estimate state-level public opinion and analyze policy responsiveness (whether policy changes in response to opinion shifts) and policy congruence (whether policies match majority opinion).


Repository Overview

This repository includes generic scripts applicable to multiple policy areas and abortion-specific scripts as a case study. The code is designed for reproducibility and modularity, allowing for adaptation to different policy domains.


Key components of this repository:

Survey Data Processing: Cleaning and structuring survey data for MRP.

MRP Public Opinion Estimation: Estimating state-level opinion using Census data.

Policy Data Processing: Preparing and merging policy data with opinion estimates.

Policy Responsiveness Analysis: Logistic regression models assessing policy shifts in response to public opinion.

Policy Congruence Analysis: Measuring how well policies align with public opinion across policy types.

Abortion-Specific Analyses: A detailed case study applying these methods to abortion policy.

This research contributes to representation theory, political behavior, and public policy analysis, providing a framework for understanding why some policies are more reflective of public opinion than others.
